# Hyundai Car Price Regression Analysis

## Introduction
This repository comprises project files on - Predicting the Resale Value of Used Hyundai Cars, which is a Regression Analysis performed using machine learning.

The primary goals of the project were:

- To understand the data and analyze the variables provided to predict the price of used Hyundai cars.
- To preprocess the data for further analysis.
- To visualize the data for correlation between the variables.
- Create necessary machine learning models using Python programming.
- Compare the accuracies of different ML models and find the one with higher accuracy.
- Hyper-Parameter Tuning for accuracy improvement.
- Conclusion
